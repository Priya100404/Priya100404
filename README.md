👋 Hey there, I’m Priya Kumari Jha, the coding enthusiast with a flair for creativity and innovation!

--👀 I'm all eyes when it comes to C++, Python, and a spectrum of web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But hey, that's not all! I'm also diving into the realms of React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express to create some dazzling projects.

--🌱 Currently, I’m nurturing my skills and constantly exploring new horizons. There's always something new to learn, right?

--💞️ I’m keen to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible. Whether it's crafting a cutting-edge frontend experience or delving deep into the backend and even some ML magic, count me in!

--📫 Reach out to me through my GitHub handle Priya100404 .Let's connect and make some coding magic happen!

😄 Pronouns: Programmer Extraordinaire, Code Connoisseur

⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that while coding, I often end up in a staring contest with my screen? Don't worry, the screen blinks first!
